   <h3>Solo Researcher Nobel Prize Winner</h3>
   
   <p id="tribute-info">Yoshinori Ohsumi (大隅 良典, Ōsumi Yoshinori, born February 9, 1945) is a Japanese cell biologist
   famous for receiving the '2016 Nobel Prize for Physiology' for his discoveries 
   on how cells recycle and renew their content, a process called autophagy. 
   Fasting and exercise activate autophagy, which helps slow down the aging process and 
    has a positive impact on cell renewal.</p>
